I am a student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science.

I have a keen interest in software engineering and I am currently taking courses in topics aimed at enhancing my theoretical knowledge and practical skills in thie field. I am also interested in and working towards learning more about databases, security, and web development.

I have experience programming in C, CSC, Python, Java, Javascript (Angular, JQuery, React), Haskell, and HTML. Additionally, I have experience with NodeJS, Git and SVN.

In my free time I enjoy spending time with my cats, knitting and playing video games.

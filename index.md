I am a student at the University of Toronto, studying Computer Science.

I have a keen interest in software engineering and am currently taking courses in topics aimed at enhancing my theoretical knowledge and practical skills in this field. I am also interested in and working towards learning more about databases, security, and web development.

I have experience with Angular, C, CSS, Express.js, Java, JavaScript, JQuery, Git, GitHub, Haskell, HTML, Latex, Node.js, Python, React, Shell Script, SVN.

I enjoy spending my free time with my partner and family members, hanging out with my cats, knitting, listening to podcasts, and playing video games.
